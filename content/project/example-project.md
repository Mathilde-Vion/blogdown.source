Aurora has two other names such as aurora borealis (for Nothern lights, in the North hemisphere) or aurora australis (for Southern lights, in the South hemisphere). It is a natural phenomenon who occurs in both Antarctic an Arctic regions. They can be seen in high altitudes when the magnetoshpere is disturbed by the solar wind. Aurora are a light made by the collisions oof electrically charged particles released from the sun that enters the atmosphere of the Earth and collide with oxygen and nitrogen.
